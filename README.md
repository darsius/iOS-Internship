To account for poor internet connectivity, it is necessary to add an Activity Indicator to the center of the screen. This will inform the user that an internet operation is in progress. The indicator should appear on a blank white screen before the list of users is populated.

After the API call is completed, the indicator should be hidden before the list is populated. To achieve this, use the UIActivityIndicatorView class provided by the UIKit framework.
